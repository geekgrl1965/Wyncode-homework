# Now that you have everyone stored in a class variable, and you gave the
# Person class the ability(method) to riot, letâ€™s adjust the riot method
# to print out all the names of the people who are rioting. So when I call

# Output:
#  The people are rising up!
#  Sandy is rioting!
#  Joe is rioting!
#  Tim is rioting!
